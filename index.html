                    <p>
                        During my last year of studies I also worked for the school
                        as 'Amanuens', a teachers assistant responsible for all
                        practical elements of the education for the whole Informatics
                        programme. It was me and a classmate and we had our own staff
                        who helped us conduct the laboratory sessions with students.
                        We helped the first year students with their introductory Java,
                        we assisted the third year students with basic database management and SQL,
                        and a CMS as end of term project. We even had a few lab sessions with our own
                        class during our fifth term Advanced Database course.

                    <h4>Media Markt</h4>
                    <p>
                        For four years before studying I worked as cashier and service employee at a large
                        electronics store. Besides the cash register I spent a lot of time at the information desk
                        helping customers with varying tasks and taking care of department email. At the service
                        department I handled returns and sending customers broken devices for repair. It was a good 
                        experience for customer relations and great motivation for studying ;)

                            During my fifth term of Informatics our project was working
                            on a project with a real company. My group and I made a
                            smartphone app for both Iphone and Android using Ionic.
                            I got a taste of NodeJs since that was our backend of choice.

                            We used <a href="https://unity3d.com/">Unity</a> for the game
                            and a PHP backend with MySQL for persistence.
