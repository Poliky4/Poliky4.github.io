          <p class="bold">
            I started learning programming on my own when I was about fifteen by
            reading tutorials online and making games. That has always been my
            favorite way to learn coding. My first game was a text only
            adventure role playing game played in the terminal. It even had
            dragons! I coded that with a friend in his basement, none of us knew
            anything about programming before but with online guides and a good
            deal of

            we made a C++ game!

          <h3>Employments</h3>
          <h4 class="no-margin">tretton37, 2018-</h4>
          <p>Developer, living the dream.</p>

          <h4 class="no-margin">Lund University, 2016-2017</h4>
          <p>
            During my last year of studies I also worked for the school as
            'Amanuens', a teachers assistant responsible for all practical
            elements of the education for the whole Informatics programme. It
            was me and a classmate and we had our own staff of students who
            helped us conduct the laboratory sessions with the younger students.
          </p>
          <p>
            We helped the first year students with their introductory Java, we
            assisted the third year students with basic database management,
            normalization and SQL. We even got to lead a few lab sessions with
            our own class during our fifth term Advanced Database course.
          </p>

          <h4 class="no-margin">Media Markt, 2012-2016</h4>
          <p>
            Before studying I worked as cashier and service employee at a large
            electronics store. Besides the cash register I spent a lot of time
            at the information desk helping customers with varying tasks and
            taking care of department email. At the service department I handled
            returns and sending customers broken devices for repair. It was a
            good experience for customer relations and great motivation for
            studying ;)
          </p>

          <h3>Education</h3>
          <h4 class="no-margin">Bachelor of Informatics, 2014-2017</h4>
          <p>
            I studied the Bachelor of Informatics at Lund University but I'm
            still a few points and a thesis away from my degree. During my
            studies I learned a lot about many different things. The focus of
            the programme is towards organizations, economics and systems design
            with a good dose of practical skills.
          </p>
          <p>
            I learned about modelling systems using UML and various database
            notations like Chen and Crowfoot. The programming courses are java,
            SQL and C#, with webservices as an important aspect. During my
            projects the last year I got to work a bit with JavaScript, first as
            a website scripting language but also with NodeJs for creating REST
            APIs.
          </p>
          <p>
            I really like JavaScript so after school I continued learning by
            reading a book ('Eloquent JavaScript') and experimenting with a few
            different small projects of my own. You can see some of them on the
            projects page.
          </p>

            During my fifth term of Informatics our project was working on a
            project with a real company. My group and I made a smartphone app
            for both Iphone and Android using Ionic. I got a taste of NodeJs
            since that was our backend of choice.

          <h4 class="no-margin">Vetrarbrautin</h4>
          <p>
            Vetrarbrautin is a 2D space invaders game for pc three classmates
            and I made as the fourth term project in my Informatics studies. We
            used <a href="https://unity3d.com/">Unity</a> with C# for the game
            and a PHP backend with MySQL for persistence.
